# Specification Quality Checklist: 3D House Viewer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:
- All mandatory sections are complete and well-structured
- User stories follow priority ordering (P1 → P2 → P3) with independent testability
- Functional requirements are specific, testable, and free of implementation details
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, FPS, percentages) without technology specifics
- Edge cases comprehensively cover error scenarios and boundary conditions
- Assumptions are clearly documented
- No clarifications needed - all requirements have reasonable defaults based on industry standards

**Notes**:
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- All requirements can be independently verified
- User stories are properly scoped for incremental delivery
