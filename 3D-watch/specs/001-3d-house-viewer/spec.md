# Feature Specification: 3D House Viewer

**Feature Branch**: `001-3d-house-viewer`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "构建一个web app应用程序,功能是3D看房，支持视角切换，用户鼠标立体拖拽"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic 3D House Viewing (Priority: P1)

A potential home buyer or renter wants to explore a property remotely by viewing a 3D model of the house in their web browser. They can load the 3D model and see the house from an initial default viewpoint.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all other features. Without the ability to load and render a 3D house model, no other interactions are possible. This represents the minimal viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the application with a sample house model and verifying that users can see a rendered 3D view of the property. Delivers immediate value by allowing remote property visualization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the web application, **When** a house model is loaded, **Then** the user sees a 3D representation of the house from a default viewpoint
2. **Given** a 3D house model is displayed, **When** the user waits for the scene to fully load, **Then** all visible surfaces, textures, and basic lighting are rendered clearly
3. **Given** the application is accessed on different devices, **When** the 3D scene loads, **Then** the rendering adapts to the device's screen size and capabilities

### User Story 2 - Mouse-based 3D Interaction (Priority: P2)

A user wants to explore the house from different angles using their mouse to orbit around the model, zoom in to see details, and pan to adjust their view position.

**Why this priority**: After establishing basic viewing capability, interactive navigation is the next critical feature. This allows users to fully explore the property from any angle, making the 3D view truly useful for property assessment.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing mouse drag operations (left-click drag for orbit, scroll for zoom, right-click drag for pan) and verifying the camera position and view changes accordingly. Delivers value by enabling hands-on exploration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a 3D house model is displayed, **When** the user clicks and drags with the left mouse button, **Then** the camera orbits around the house while maintaining a fixed focal point
2. **Given** a 3D house model is displayed, **When** the user scrolls the mouse wheel, **Then** the camera zooms in or out smoothly without jarring movements
3. **Given** a 3D house model is displayed, **When** the user clicks and drags with the right mouse button (or middle button), **Then** the camera pans laterally and vertically
4. **Given** the user is interacting with the 3D model, **When** they release the mouse button, **Then** the camera movement stops smoothly with appropriate damping

### User Story 3 - Preset Viewpoint Switching (Priority: P3)

A user wants to quickly jump to predefined viewpoints (e.g., front entrance, living room, kitchen, bedroom, backyard) to efficiently tour the property without manual navigation.

**Why this priority**: Preset viewpoints enhance the user experience by providing guided tours and ensuring users don't miss important areas. While valuable, the feature depends on having basic viewing and navigation working first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking on viewpoint selection controls and verifying the camera smoothly transitions to predefined positions. Delivers value by streamlining property exploration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a 3D house model is displayed with multiple preset viewpoints defined, **When** the user selects a viewpoint from a list or menu, **Then** the camera smoothly transitions to that viewpoint within 1 second
2. **Given** the user is viewing the house from a preset viewpoint, **When** they select a different preset viewpoint, **Then** the camera animates from the current position to the new position along an optimal path
3. **Given** preset viewpoints are available, **When** the user hovers over or selects a viewpoint option, **Then** a preview or label indicates which area of the house that viewpoint will show
4. **Given** the user has navigated manually away from a preset viewpoint, **When** they select that same preset again, **Then** the camera returns to the exact predefined position and orientation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the 3D model file is corrupted or fails to load?
- How does the system handle very large house models that may impact performance?
- What happens when a user tries to zoom beyond reasonable limits (too close or too far)?
- How does the application behave on devices without mouse input (touch-only devices)?
- What happens when the user rapidly switches between multiple preset viewpoints in quick succession?
- How does the system handle houses with multiple floors or complex geometries?
- What happens if the user's browser or device doesn't support required 3D rendering capabilities?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST load and render 3D house models in standard formats (GLTF/GLB preferred)
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a loading progress indicator while 3D models are being fetched and parsed
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide intuitive mouse controls for orbiting (left-click drag), zooming (scroll wheel), and panning (right-click or middle-click drag)
- **FR-004**: System MUST support smooth camera transitions when switching between viewpoints with configurable animation duration
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain stable frame rates during all camera movements and interactions
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide visual feedback during user interactions (e.g., cursor changes, visual cues)
- **FR-007**: System MUST define and store preset viewpoint configurations including camera position, target point, and viewing angle
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent camera navigation beyond reasonable boundaries (e.g., no going underground or infinitely far away)
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages when models fail to load
- **FR-010**: System MUST adapt rendering quality based on device capabilities to maintain performance targets

### Key Entities

- **House Model**: Represents the 3D geometry, textures, and materials of a property; includes metadata such as model file path, bounding box dimensions, and default lighting settings
- **Viewpoint**: Represents a predefined camera configuration including position coordinates (x, y, z), target/look-at point, field of view, and associated label/description
- **Camera State**: Represents the current viewing configuration including position, orientation, zoom level, and movement constraints
- **Scene Configuration**: Represents global 3D scene settings including lighting setup, background environment, and rendering quality parameters

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully load and view a 3D house model within 3 seconds of opening the application on standard broadband connections
- **SC-002**: Users can smoothly navigate around the 3D model with all mouse interactions responding within 100 milliseconds
- **SC-003**: Application maintains a frame rate of at least 30 FPS on mid-range devices (minimum 24 FPS on low-end mobile devices) during all interactions
- **SC-004**: 90% of users can successfully explore all major areas of a house using mouse navigation without instruction or assistance
- **SC-005**: Camera transitions between preset viewpoints complete within 1 second and are perceived as smooth by users
- **SC-006**: Application works correctly on at least 95% of tested devices across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge browsers (latest 2 versions)
- **SC-007**: Users can complete a full property tour using preset viewpoints in under 2 minutes
- **SC-008**: Error recovery rate is 100% - all model loading failures display helpful error messages without crashing the application

## Assumptions

- Users have access to modern web browsers with WebGL support
- 3D house models are provided in optimized formats suitable for web rendering
- Network bandwidth is sufficient for loading models up to several megabytes in size
- Default lighting and environment settings are adequate for property visualization
- Users are familiar with standard mouse interactions (click, drag, scroll)
- Preset viewpoints will be configured during model preparation, not dynamically generated
- The primary use case is on desktop/laptop devices, though mobile support is desired
- No authentication or user accounts are required for basic viewing functionality
