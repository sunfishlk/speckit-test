# Feature Specification: 2048 Web Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-2048-game`  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "html css js react框架制作"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Play Basic 2048 Game (Priority: P1)

A player can play the classic 2048 game by swiping on mobile or using arrow keys on desktop to merge tiles and reach the 2048 tile.

**Why this priority**: Core gameplay is the MVP - without this, there is no game. All other features depend on this fundamental mechanic.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the game, making moves with arrow keys/swipes, merging tiles, and verifying score increases. Delivers a complete, playable 2048 game.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new game starts, **When** the player loads the page, **Then** a 4x4 grid appears with two random tiles (value 2 or 4)
2. **Given** tiles are on the grid, **When** player swipes/presses arrow key in a direction, **Then** all tiles slide to that direction until blocked
3. **Given** two tiles with same value are adjacent, **When** they move together, **Then** they merge into one tile with double value and score increases
4. **Given** player makes a move, **When** move completes, **Then** a new random tile (2 or 4) appears in an empty cell
5. **Given** player reaches 2048 tile, **When** tile appears, **Then** victory message displays with option to continue
6. **Given** no valid moves remain, **When** grid is full, **Then** game over message displays with final score

### User Story 2 - Game Controls & Restart (Priority: P2)

Player can restart the game at any time and receive clear feedback about game state (score, best score, moves).

**Why this priority**: Essential UX improvements that make the game replayable and trackable, but game is functional without them.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by playing a game, clicking "New Game" button, verifying state resets, and checking that best score persists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** game is in progress, **When** player clicks "New Game" button, **Then** grid resets with two random tiles and score resets to 0
2. **Given** game ends with a score, **When** new game starts, **Then** best score is preserved and displayed
3. **Given** player makes moves, **When** each move completes, **Then** current score updates immediately with animation
4. **Given** player is on mobile, **When** they swipe in any direction, **Then** page doesn't scroll, only game responds

### User Story 3 - Smooth Animations & Visual Polish (Priority: P3)

Tiles animate smoothly when moving and merging, with visual feedback for score increases and state changes.

**Why this priority**: Enhances game feel significantly but core functionality works without animations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making moves and observing tile slide animations, merge effects, and score pop-ups run at 60fps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** player makes a move, **When** tiles slide, **Then** movement animates smoothly over 150-200ms
2. **Given** two tiles merge, **When** merge happens, **Then** tile scales up briefly with visual feedback
3. **Given** score increases, **When** points are added, **Then** score change animates with +points indicator
4. **Given** new tile appears, **When** generated, **Then** tile fades/scales in from empty cell

### Edge Cases

- What happens when player presses arrow key but no tiles can move in that direction? (No action, no new tile spawns)
- How does system handle rapid key presses? (Queue or debounce to prevent state corruption)
- What if both 2 and 4 tiles can spawn - what's the probability? (90% chance of 2, 10% chance of 4)
- How to handle game state when browser refreshes? (Optional: localStorage persistence)
- What happens on very small screens (<320px)? (Game should still be playable with minimum sizing)
