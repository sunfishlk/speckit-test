# 2048 Web Game Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Component-Based UI Architecture

The game MUST be built using modular, reusable components with clear separation of concerns. UI components (grid, tiles, scoreboard, controls) MUST be independently developed and testable. Each component MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility. No monolithic code structures are permitted.

**Rationale**: Component architecture enables independent development, easier testing, maintainability, and supports incremental feature additions without breaking existing functionality.

### II. State Management Clarity

Game state (grid, score, game status) MUST be centralized and managed through a clear, predictable pattern. State updates MUST be explicit and traceable. UI rendering MUST be purely reactive to state changes. Direct DOM manipulation outside of the rendering cycle is prohibited.

**Rationale**: Clear state management prevents bugs, makes the game logic testable, enables undo/redo features, and simplifies debugging by creating a single source of truth.

### III. Mobile-First Responsive Design

The game MUST work seamlessly on mobile devices (touch controls) as the primary interface. Desktop support (keyboard controls) is secondary. The UI MUST adapt to different screen sizes without loss of functionality. Touch gestures (swipe) and keyboard input (arrow keys) MUST both be fully supported.

**Rationale**: Mobile gaming is the primary use case for casual puzzle games. Mobile-first ensures accessibility and wider user reach while maintaining desktop compatibility.

### IV. Performance & Smooth Animations

All animations MUST run at 60fps. Tile movements and merges MUST be smooth and instant-feeling. Game logic MUST execute in <16ms per frame. No animation jank or lag is acceptable. Use CSS transforms and GPU acceleration where possible.

**Rationale**: Smooth animations are critical for game feel and user satisfaction. Poor performance breaks immersion and makes the game frustrating to play.

### V. Progressive Enhancement

Core gameplay MUST work without JavaScript frameworks or libraries. Enhanced features (animations, touch gestures, scoring effects) are additive. The game MUST be playable in degraded environments. No external dependencies that block core functionality.

**Rationale**: Ensures maximum compatibility, faster load times, and resilience. Users can play even with limited connectivity or older browsers.

## User Experience Standards

### Intuitive Gameplay

- Game rules MUST be discoverable through play (no tutorial required)
- Visual feedback MUST be immediate for every user action
- Score changes MUST be clearly indicated with animation or effects
- Game over state MUST be obvious with clear restart option
- New game option MUST be accessible at all times

### Accessibility

- Color choices MUST provide sufficient contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- Touch targets MUST be at least 44×44px
- Keyboard navigation MUST support all game functions
- Game state MUST be understandable without audio
- Support for reduced motion preferences where possible

## Code Quality & Testing

### Testing Requirements

- Game logic (move calculation, tile merging, win/loss detection) MUST have unit tests
- UI components MUST be testable in isolation
- Integration tests MUST verify touch and keyboard input handling
- Visual regression tests SHOULD be considered for tile animations
- Tests are OPTIONAL unless explicitly specified in feature requirements

### Code Standards

- Functions MUST be pure where possible (no side effects)
- Magic numbers MUST be replaced with named constants (grid size, tile values)
- Code MUST be linted and formatted consistently
- Comments MUST explain "why", not "what"
- Git commits MUST be atomic and descriptive

## Governance

### Amendment Process

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
1. Documented rationale for the change
2. Impact assessment on existing codebase
3. Update to affected templates and documentation
4. Version increment following semantic versioning rules

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible principle changes or removals
- **MINOR**: New principles added or significant expansions
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic changes

### Compliance

- All specifications and plans MUST verify alignment with these principles
- Feature implementations MUST document any principle deviations with justification
- Code reviews MUST enforce constitutional compliance
- Complexity additions MUST be justified against simpler alternatives

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-29 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-29
